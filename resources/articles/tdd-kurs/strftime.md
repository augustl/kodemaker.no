### Test and add a feature to strftime

One example of strftime from other languages is
[that of Ruby](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Time.html#method-i-strftime).
Look up the documentation for the format specifier `%j`. Describe its
functionality in one or more tests, and make sure you make it run green. Grab
the setup by cloning this repo:

```sh
git clone http://kurs.kodemaker.no/tdd-kurs/strftime.git
```

**Tip!** Start with as simple cases as you can - it should be easy to manually
verify that what the test asserts makes sense (at least the first test/simplest
case).

#### Done?

If you finish quickly, find another format specifier, add a test and
implementation for it.
