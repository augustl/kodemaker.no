### Test and add a feature to strftime

One example of strftime from other languages is
[that of Ruby](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.4/Time.html#method-i-strftime).
Look up the documentation for the format specifier `%j`. Describe its
functionality in one or more tests, and make them pass by implementing the
switch. Grab the setup by cloning this repo:

`git clone http://git.tddjs.no/strftime.git`

If you finish quickly, find another format specifier, add a test and
implementation for it.
